 * This allows us to create a panel which we can add to a frame/window
 * Oftentimes, you would then add standard GUI components, e.g. JButton, JLabel, to the
 * panel.
 * In our case, though, we will want to draw shapes, so we override the paintComponent() method
 * that we inherit from the javax.swing.JPanel class.
 * The graphics system passes us a java.awt.Graphics object and this has methods which allows us
 * to draw shapes.
